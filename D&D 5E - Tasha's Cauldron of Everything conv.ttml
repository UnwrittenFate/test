      <p begin="0.0s" xml:id="p0" end="1.0s">ARTIFICER<br />Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in ob­ jects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.<br />Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist&#039;s supplies to create a potent elixir, callig­ rapher&#039;s supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tin­ ker&#039;s tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p>
      <p begin="1.0s" xml:id="p1" end="2.0s">ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDS</p>
      <p begin="2.0s" xml:id="p2" end="3.0s">Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction un­<br />leashed by certain artificers&#039; creations.</p>
      <p begin="3.0s" xml:id="p3" end="4.0s">In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragon­ lance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk<br />to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, var­ ious nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.<br />Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that<br />others deem unfixable. In Vi&#039;s home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and de­ ployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.</p>

Add half your levels (rounded up) in<br />the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other<br />classes to determine your available spell slots.</p>
      <p begin="27.0s" xml:id="p27" end="28.0s">IO CHAPTER I I CHARACTER OPTIONS<br />CLASS FEATURES<br />As an artificer, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Artificer table.</p>
      <p begin="28.0s" xml:id="p28" end="29.0s">MAGICAL TINKERING</p>
      <p begin="29.0s" xml:id="p29" end="30.0s">1st-level artificer feature<br />You&#039;ve learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves&#039; tools or artisan&#039;s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:<br />• The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.<br />• Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.<br />• The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceiv­ able up to 10 feet away.<br />• A static visual effect appears on one of the object&#039;s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.<br />The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the prop­ erty early.<br />You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one ob­ ject). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new prop­ erty applies.</p>
      <p begin="30.0s" xml:id="p30" end="31.0s">SPELLCASTING<br />1st-level artificer feature<br />You&#039;ve studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don&#039;t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.·</p>
      <p begin="31.0s" xml:id="p31" end="32.0s">TOOLS REQUIRED<br />You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifi­ cally thieves&#039; tools or some kind of artisan&#039;s tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting<br />feature (meaning the spell has an &quot;M&quot; component</p>
      <p begin="32.0s" xml:id="p32" end="33.0s">THE MACIC OF ARTIFICE<br />As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you&#039;re using a tool. For example, if you cast cure wounds using alchemist&#039;s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker&#039;s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same either way.<br />Such details don&#039;t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell&#039;s effects. You don&#039;t have to justify how you&#039;re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>
      <p begin="33.0s" xml:id="p33" end="34.0s">when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chap­ ter in the Player&#039;s Handbook for descriptions of these tools.<br />After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infu­ sions as a spellcasting focus.</p>
      <p begin="34.0s" xml:id="p34" end="35.0s">CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)<br />You know two cantrips of your choice from the arti­ ficer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.<br />When you gain a level in this class, you can re­ place one of the artificer can trips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>
      <p begin="35.0s" xml:id="p35" end="36.0s">PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS<br />The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must ex­ pend a slot of the spell&#039;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br />You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of arti­ ficer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br />For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#039;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br />You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artifi­ cer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level<br />for each spell on your list.</p>
      <p begin="36.0s" xml:id="p36" end="37.0s">CHAPTER I I CHARACTER OPTIONS<br />SPELLCASTING ABILITY<br />Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arti­ ficer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br />Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br />Spell attack modifier= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br />RITUAL CASTING<br />You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell<br />has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

The list is organized by spell level, not charader level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell&#039;s name.<br />Each spell is in the Player&#039;s Handbook, unless it has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two aster­ isks (a spell in Xanathar&#039;s Guide to Everything).</p>

      <p begin="49.0s" xml:id="p49" end="50.0s">INFUSING AN ITEM<br />Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion&#039;s description. If the item re­ quires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal pro­ cess for attunement (see the attunement rules in the<br />Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide).</p>
      <p begin="50.0s" xml:id="p50" end="51.0s">12 CHAPTER I I CHARACTER OPTIONS<br />Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (mini­ mum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.<br />You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infu­ sion ends, and then the new infusion applies.<br />.<br />If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag ofholding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>

      <p begin="54.0s" xml:id="p54" end="55.0s">MAGIC ITEM ADEPT<br />10th-level artificer feature<br />You&#039;ve achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:<br />• You can attune to up to four magic items at once. • If you craft a magic item with a rarity of com­<br />mon or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.</p>
